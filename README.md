# **Bryan Godwin - Week 5 Challenge**

## **Third Party API Challenge: Work Day Scheduler**

### This challenge is to build a simple calendar application that allows a user to save each hour of the day

### **User Story**

    AS AN employee with a busy schedule
    I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
    SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

### **Acceptance Critera**

1.  Current day is displayed

        WHEN I open the planner
        THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

2.  User can scroll through entire day one hour at a time

        WHEN I scroll down
        THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

3.  Time blocks are color-coded

        WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
        THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

4.  User can enter event information

        WHEN I click into a time block
        THEN I can enter an event

5.  User can save event information

        WHEN I click the save button for that time block
        THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

6.  User event information is persisted

        WHEN I refresh the page
        THEN the saved events persist
